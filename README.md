# Chitu-L-V3---Machine-Parameters
This is the Machine Parameters for conversion of Anycubic Photon or Photon S to FHD Mono using Chitu L V3 PCB.
This is essencialy the gcode parameters used on Elegoo Mars 2 pro with some few tweaks to make it work properly on Chitu L V3.
I adapted this parameter file because Chitu L V3 is shipped with a different configuration from Anycubic, so the stepper motor turns on wrong direction and fan controls acts differently than the original PCB from Photon's.
Take care using the gcode file provided by Chitu Systems, because it has a flaw that make z axis to do erratic movements. This parameter file also correct this.
Altought it is working absolutely fine for me, use it at your own risk.
